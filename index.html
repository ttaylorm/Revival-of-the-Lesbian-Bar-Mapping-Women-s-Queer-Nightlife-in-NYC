<p> Lesbian bars, like their heterosexual counterparts, come in a range of forms. From casual bars
like the Woods, the Bush, or Cubbyhole to drag shows at Henrietta Hudson and raves at
Purgatory, lesbian events are rich with culture and history in New York City. <p/> 

<p> NBC reports, “There are at least 35 venues geared toward queer women across the U.S., with more than a dozen opening their doors since 2020”. Six of the venues on this list are located in New York City, making it an interesting case study for the revival of lesbian nightlife. Following decades of the lesbian bars’ decline, mapping lesbian bars and their attributes can empower queer people to guarantee a fun night out in NYC. <p/>

<p> One lesbian event that has become popular in NYC is the iconic Woods Wednesday where in the words of content-creator Brittnia, “everybody’s ex is dating somebody else’s ex’s ex”. While some events promote cruising, encouraging people to find sexual partners, others like Woods Wednesday or Cubbyhole can serve as important spaces for queer friendship building and community care. Queer spaces in NYC sometimes use a traffic light sticker system: green for single, red for taken, and yellow for something in-between. <p/>
<p> Queer spaces are historically important because they provide sanctuary for Black and trans members of the LGBTQ+ community. GGG, for example, hosts events specifically geared towards Black, trans and nonbinary people and bars like The Bush have become known for being POC friendly. <p/>
<p> The renaissance of lesbian bars is especially important post-pandemic and under the Trump administration, as they provide a necessary safe space for queer people to find companionship and make new connections. <p/>
